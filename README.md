# [Wikifeedia](http://vishnuks.com/wikifeedia) - Wikipedia delivered as a Newsfeed

I love Wikipedia. It is the first place I would go in the World Wide Web  whenever I want to learn more about some stuff. Like me most of the netizens use Wikipedia only when they want to learn more about something and not for fun like Quora. I consider this as a problem.  Wikifeedia was made to fix that problem. Wikifeedia generates a news feed of awesome Wikipedia articles along with category that I hope would bring back people to use Wikipeedia for fun. The site also has an awesome search function that returns all the articles under a particular category. 

##How it works?

The home page of Wikifeedia consist of a news feed of Featured articles. Featured articles are considered to be the best articles Wikipedia has to offer, as determined by Wikipedia's editors. As of now there is no API for getting a list of random featured articles. So I had to mix many of the Wikipedia features like Random API to make an awesome random article generator for Featured article. See my  blog post for more details. 

The backend of Wikifeedia can be found [here](https://github.com/hackerkid/Wikifeedia-Backend). Don't send pull request to master branch of backend repositary directly as it is synced with the Heroku. 


##Contributing
The website is made mostly of Javascript. It would be great if the new contributions are implemented in Browser rather than in server as I have no plan now for moving the website from Github pages as of now. There is a great amount of work to be done in improving the UI of the Website. Send pull requests only to the master branch.
